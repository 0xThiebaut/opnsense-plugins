            Normally, Zeek's event engine will discard packets which don't have valid checksums.
            This can be a problem if one wants to analyze locally generated/captured traffic on a
            system that offloads checksumming to the network adapter. In that case, all
            transmitted/captured packets will have bad checksums because they haven't yet been
            calculated by the NIC, thus such packets will not undergo analysis defined in Zeek policy
            scripts as they normally would. Bad checksums in traces may also be a result of some
            packet alteration tools.
